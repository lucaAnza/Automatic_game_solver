Using AI to autosolve a game hosted on a Windows machine

# MAIN-STEPS

## 1. Implemenet image processor 
Using adequate libraries implement a processor able to distinguish between different shapes

## 2. Matrix of image items
Fill a matrix 6x5 of images that have to be encoded, each image equals a different integer

## 3. Algorithm to find feasible solution
Write an algo capable of outputting a valid move in order to continue the game given an input matrix of images (in number notation)
