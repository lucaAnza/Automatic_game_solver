Automating the solution of a game hosted on a Windows machine

# MAIN-STEPS

## 1. Implemenet image processor

Using adequate libraries implement a processor able to distinguish between different shapes

## 2. Matrix of image items

OpenCV

## 3. Algorithm

Standard library

## 4. Automation

Use Bluestack's macros

# STEPS

## 1. Autome resolution for online game ( no algoritm )

- Learn PyAutoGUIâ€™s ("https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/")
- Automate playing a web-based game ("https://play2048.com/")
  - Simple imput of: RIGHT-LEFT-UP-DOWN

## 2. Recognize numbers from an image using IA

1. One digit integer
2. Multiple digit integer
3. Matrix of integers

## 3. Recognize item using pixels ( No IA )

## 4. Implement algoritm that can resolve a game like candy crush 

## 5. Merge -> Macro + Recogniser + Algoritm in order to create a bot that is able to play alone.
