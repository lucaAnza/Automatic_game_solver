# V1

(-) Messy code.
(-) Decision algoritm has bugs.
(-) Analise is computationally intensive.
(-) Macro's are not native, they are made with Bluestacks.
(-) File *requirements.txt* not available

## Main features

### 1. Pixel analisys

Made with OpenCV, is able to recognise the different between object in a specific set.  
(-) It is implemented with sums of pixel and average of them. This make the software computationally intensive.

## 2. Game solver

Algorithm that takes an input matrix of objects and returns the best move.
Has some bugs.

```mermaid
graph LR;
    A(Input) -- Matrix --> Algoritm;
    Algoritm -- Moves --> B(Output)
```

## 3. Game controller

Create Bluestacks's macro's.

## 4. Notification interface

**NOT IMPLEMENTED*
